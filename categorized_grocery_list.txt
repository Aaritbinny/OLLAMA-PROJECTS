I'd be happy to help you categorize and sort your grocery items! Here is the organized list:

**Produce**
• Apples
• Carrots
• Lettuce
• Onions
• Potatoes
• Spinach
• Tomatoes

**Dairy**
• Cheese
• Eggs
• Milk
• Yogurt

**Bakery**
• Atta (Note: This is a type of Indian flatbread, so it might not fit in the traditional bakery category. If you'd like to keep it separate, I can categorize it as "Grains" instead.)

**Grains**
• All-purpose flour
• Atta
• Pasta
• Rice

**Meat**
• Chicken breast

**Beverages**
• Apple juice
• Coffee powder
• Orange juice
• Tea powder

**Sauces and Condiments**
• Chilli sauce
• Ketchup
• Sugar

Note: I've kept the ketchup under "Sauces and Condiments" as it's a condiment, but if you'd like to categorize it as a "Beverage" (in the form of a sweetener), let me know!

Let me know if this helps, or if you have any further requests!
